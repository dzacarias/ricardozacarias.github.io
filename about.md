title:  "Ricardo Zacarias | About"

Hi, I'm Ricardo. I've always wanted to be a scientist but then I became one. After finishing a PhD in neuroscience I figured that I would much rather play around with other people's data than generate my own. Also I like maps.

This website aims to share short-stories based on statistics that also entertain.
