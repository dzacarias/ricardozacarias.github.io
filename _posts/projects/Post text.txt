que abrimos a 5 de Novembro de 2010, a primeira “Padaria Portuguesa”, na Av. João XXI, em Lisboa.
9 years later they are 63.

To restrict my analysis geographically, I will only use padarias inside the city limits of lisbon. This reduces the number to 45.


Little Tutorial on Coordinate systeand geopandas

Shapely knows nothing about your units. Therefore, when you call polygon.buffer(0.2), shapely will buffer the coordinates in polygon by 0.2 units. In your case, these are not meters, but degrees.

If you want to buffer in meters, you first need to reproject your Polygon and Linestring into a CRS that uses meters. I would use geopandas for this, as it has a convenient .to_crs() method that will do the reprojection quickly. This also requires that you know the CRS of the coordinates you're providing (likely they are epsg:4326). You could also use pyproj, which might be easier if you're not dealing with layers with many polygons:

However, all projections will have some distortions that vary (usually) with distance from the equator (or the projection's central latitude). One commonly-used option is to determine which UTM Zone your region of interest lies within, then choose the appropriate EPSG.

EPSG:3763
