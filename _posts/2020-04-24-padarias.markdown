Abstract: I guess the abstract goes here.



["A Padaria Portuguesa"](https://www.apadariaportuguesa.pt/) 

Abrimos a 5 de Novembro de 2010, a primeira “Padaria Portuguesa”, na Av. João XXI, em Lisboa.

As of April 2020 they have 62 locations in the greater Lisbon area. These days it's kind of hard to walk around the city without stumbling into one of these places.

This made me wonder: what is the actual reach of this business in terms of percentage of area covered?

To answer this question the first thing we need are the coordinates of every single location. Luckily for us, Zomato has a free [API](https://developers.zomato.com/api) which has some limits, but very rich and easy to use. 

I also need a frame of reference, ie the city limits of Lisbon, which is available [here](http://geodados.cm-lisboa.pt/datasets/freguesias-2012).
