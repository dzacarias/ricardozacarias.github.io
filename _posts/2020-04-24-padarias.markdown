TLDR: combined data from Zomato's API and geometric manipulations to estimate the proportion of Lisbon's surface area and population that lies within a 5-min walk of a Padaria Portuguesa. 

<h1 id="posts-label"></h1>

[A Padaria Portuguesa](https://www.apadariaportuguesa.pt/) is a modern-styled yet somehow traditional bakery born and raised in the heart of Lisbon's hipster revolution. Their primordial boutique opened its doors the 5th of November (remember, remember?) of 2010 at the prime location of [Avenida Jo√£o XXI](https://goo.gl/maps/dSrT1qnjpWMwwu4M6). Since then, additional shops have been popping up like mushrooms after the rain. Nearly a decade later, they have reached all but omnipresence in the city, and currently own a whopping **62 locations** in the greater Lisbon area.

This meteoric rise made me wonder how much of the city are they able to reach?

To answer this question the first thing we need are the coordinates of every single location. Luckily for us, Zomato has a free [API](https://developers.zomato.com/api) which has some limits, but very rich and easy to use. 

I also need a frame of reference, ie the city limits of Lisbon, which is available [here](http://geodados.cm-lisboa.pt/datasets/freguesias-2012).
