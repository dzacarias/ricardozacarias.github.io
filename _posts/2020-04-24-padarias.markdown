TLDR: combined data from Zomato's API and geometric manipulations to estimate the proportion of Lisbon's surface area and population that lies within a 5-min walking distance of a Padaria Portuguesa.

[A Padaria Portuguesa](https://www.apadariaportuguesa.pt/) is a modern-styled yet traditional bakery/café which first opened its doors the 5th of November (classic) of 2010 at the prime location of Avenida João XXI in the heart of Lisbon. Just shy of 10 years later, they have reached near omnipresence in the city, currently owning **62** locations in the greater Lisbon area. These days it's kind of hard to walk around the city without stumbling into one of these places.

This meteoric rise made me wonder how much of the city are they able to reach?

To answer this question the first thing we need are the coordinates of every single location. Luckily for us, Zomato has a free [API](https://developers.zomato.com/api) which has some limits, but very rich and easy to use. 

I also need a frame of reference, ie the city limits of Lisbon, which is available [here](http://geodados.cm-lisboa.pt/datasets/freguesias-2012).

### Union of 500-meter radius around each location

To estimate coverage, I drew a 500-meter radius around each of the locations, calculated the union between all these circles and finally measured its area.
