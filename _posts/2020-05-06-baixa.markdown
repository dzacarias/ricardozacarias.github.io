TLDR: It's pretty much just a GIF. Used data from OpenStreetMap and city government to visualize construction permits issued for Lisbon's historical center.

While I was doing research for a short article on tourism, my progress was acutely derailed by a [dataset](http://geodados.cm-lisboa.pt/datasets/alvarás-para-obras-de-edificação-e-demolição){:target="_blank"} about construction permits (I know, it sounds like a thrilling story already...). I didn't think much of it myself until I realized it was a [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile){:target="_blank"}. 

> *The shapefile format is a geospatial vector data format for geographic information system (GIS) software.*

In practical terms this means that for each data point, besides information about the project itself (for example if its a demolition, construction or alteration), there was also a **polygon** describing its shape and its geographical location. This made it easy to plot.

This picture showed some potential but it was definitely missing something. First of all, it needed some context. Instead of just drawing the neighborhood borders to contain the data, I thought the best option would be to also plot buildings that were **not** subject to any development. If only there was some sort of [open source alternative](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about){:target="_blank"} to Google Maps.

While this already looks much better, there are way too many buildings in the city to be able to see anything clearly. I decided to focus on the region with the highest density of buildings and construction, the downtown or 'a baixa' (neighborhood [Santa Maria Maior](https://www.jf-santamariamaior.pt/){:target="_blank"}).

In an attempt to elevate this project into something more than just eye candy, I decided to try and estimate the percentage of buildings that were modified in the last 10 years. This was tricky because of reasons: 

- The polygons in the permit database did not match exactly the ones found on OpenStreetMap;
- A lot of permits actually cover more than one building;
- Comparing orange area with grey area was not feasible because of exterior projects (see Martim Moniz Square for an example);

My solution was to define a representative point for every building and then checking each of them to see if they fell within an orange polygon. Using this strategy I estimated that, in the past decade, **2,003** buildings out of a total of **2,799** were subject to some form of construction project that required a license. That is **71.6%** and sounds like *a lot*. 

Maybe my estimations are way off or perhaps you need a permit to change a lightbulb in this city. But when you consider that in this neighborhood there were **85,557** AirBnB reviews for **2,994** unique listings it doesn't sound so crazy after all. 



**Finally, because the data spans 10 years and I like to dabble in video editing, here's a movie:**
