TLDR: this is more of a teaser post than an actual story. It's pretty much just a GIF. Used data from Open Street Maps and city hall to visualize construction permits issued for Lisbon's historical center.

While I was doing research for a short article on tourism, my progress was acutely derailed by a [dataset](http://geodados.cm-lisboa.pt/datasets/alvarás-para-obras-de-edificação-e-demolição) about construction permits (I know, it sounds like a thrilling story already...). I didn't think much of it myself until I realized it was a [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile). 

> *The shapefile format is a geospatial vector data format for geographic information system (GIS) software.*

In practical terms this means that for each construction permit, besides information about the project itself (for example it its a demolition, construction or alteration), there was also a **polygon** describing its shape and its geographical location. This makes it easy to visualize.

This picture showed some potential but it was definitely missing something. First of all, it needs some context. Instead of just drawing the neighborhood borders to contain this picture I realized that the best answer would be also plot buildings that were not subject to any development. 

First of all, there are way too many buildings in the city to be able to see anything interesting.
