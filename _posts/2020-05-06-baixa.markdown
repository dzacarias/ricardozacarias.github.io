TLDR: this is more of a teaser post than an actual story. It's pretty much just a GIF. Used data from Open Street Maps and city hall to visualize construction permits issued for Lisbon's historical center.

While I was doing research for a short article on tourism, my progress was acutely derailed by a [dataset](http://geodados.cm-lisboa.pt/datasets/alvarás-para-obras-de-edificação-e-demolição) about construction permits (I know, it sounds like a thrilling story already...). I didn't think much of it myself until I realized it was a [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile).

In practical terms this means that for each construction permit there was also a **polygon** describing its shape and its geographical location. Let's see it.
