TLDR: this is more of a teaser post than an actual story. It's pretty much just a GIF. Used data from Open Street Maps and city hall to visualize construction permits issued for Lisbon's historical center.

While I was doing research for a short article on tourism, my progress was acutely derailed by a [dataset](http://geodados.cm-lisboa.pt/datasets/alvarás-para-obras-de-edificação-e-demolição){:target="_blank"} about construction permits (I know, it sounds like a thrilling story already...). I didn't think much of it myself until I realized it was a [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile){:target="_blank"}.

In practical terms this means that for each construction permit, besides information about the project itself (for example it its a demolition, construction or alteration), there was also a **polygon** describing its shape and its geographical location. This makes it easy to visualize.

This picture showed some potential but it was definitely missing something. First of all, it needed some context. Instead of just drawing the neighborhood borders to contain the data, I realized the best option would be to also plot buildings that were **not** subject to any development. If only there was some sort of [open source alternative](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about){:target="_blank"} to Google Maps.

While this already looks much better, there are way too many buildings in the city to be able to see anything clearly. I decided to focus on the region with the highest density of buildings and construction, downtown (Santa Maria Maior)
