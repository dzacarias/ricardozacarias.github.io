TLDR: this is more of a teaser post than an actual story. It's pretty much just a GIF.

While I was doing research for a short story on tourism, my progress was acutely derailed by a dataset about construction permits. I know, it already sounds extremely exciting. I didn't think much of it myself until I realized it was a [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile).

In practical terms this means that for each construction permit there was also a **polygon** describing its shape and its geographical location.
