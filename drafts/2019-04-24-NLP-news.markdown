TLDR: just a list of analysis.

<h1 id="posts-label"></h1>

Project ideas:

1. text analysis on different portuguese newspapers
2. Airbnb and quarantine (maybe wait for INE data from first semester of 2020)
   - % of entire apartments across cities
   - % of multi listings
   - Vs official numbers of alojamento local
3. API Carris
4. API EMEL
5. Other Zomato data.
