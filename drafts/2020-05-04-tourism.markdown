TLDR: I crossed data from AirBnB, construction permits and rent prices to put numbers behind the debate concerning the recent explosion of tourism in Lisbon

<h1 id="posts-label"></h1>



Data Sources:

Every building in Portugal [source](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/portugal.html).

Construction permits by Camara Municipal de Lisboa [here]([http://geodados.cm-lisboa.pt/datasets/alvar%C3%A1s-para-obras-de-edifica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-e-demoli%C3%A7%C3%A3o](http://geodados.cm-lisboa.pt/datasets/alvarás-para-obras-de-edificação-e-demolição)).

AirBnB listings and review data [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

Median rent by neighbourhood [here](https://ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpgid=ine_main&xpid=INE).

Isn't it funny how we all love to travel but hate tourists?



AirBnB started as an 'original' idea of two roommates placing an extra mattress in the living room. Otherwise known as monetizing couch surfing (which started way back in 2003).

The exponential growth of AirBnB listings in Lisbon has been documented... extensively. But not by me!

(reviews over time)

Wow this graph really has the shape of a sustainable process doesn't it?



Got the data from the awesome [insideairbnb.com](). A watchdog website that keeps track 

Exact location provided after booking

- Location information for listings are anonymized by Airbnb.

- - In practice, this means the location for a listing on the map, or in the data will be from 0-450 feet (150 metres) of the actual address.
  - Listings in the same building are anonymized by Airbnb individually, and therefore may appear "scattered" in the area surrounding the actual address.



We can't deny that our city is looking sharp. The only problem is we can't afford it.
